Tracking Protection Dashboard
==============================

Telemetry dashboard for tracking protection.

## Tracking Protection Shield Events

The unit is percentage (0 to 1). It shows that roughly 80% of pages don't have a shield showing up for example.

## Tracking Protection Shield Events

Same as the first graph but in number of reports, not as a percentage.

## Tracking Protection Sessions Enabled

Percentage of sessions that have TP enabled. People who close their browsers a lot are over-represented, since closing the browser gives you a new session.

Having this in FHR will be more accurate, see <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1130473>.

## Tracking Protection Enable/Disable Events

Number of times people enable/disable the tracking protection feature somehow.
